# Battery considerations
* To preserve the battery life, bluetooth should only be on when configuring the remote. If you forget to turn it off, the remote will disable bluetooth in 5 minutes
* The remote will go into ultra low power mode if it fails to connect to a device within ~30 seconds, or if no buttons are pressed for 1 hour. The system wakes up from ultra low power when the user presses any button.
* It is expected that a coin cell will be able to power the remote for one bicycle season. (6-12 months) 
* replace the battery annually.
